MIDI2KEY is a very small utility to accept note ON and note OFF events from all MIDI input devices installed on a the user's computer and translating them into key strokes applicable to LOTRO (http://www.lotro.com) music system commands.

Release notes for v0.9.0.4:
- Added ability to customize key mapping via a MIDI2KEY.ini file in the same directory as the executable. Several example ini files are included. To use one of them, rename it to "MIDI2KEY.ini" and restart the program. The program will use a default key mapping if no "MIDI2KEY.ini" file is present.

Release notes for v0.9.0.3:
- Includes a simple arpeggiator function. When enabled, simply hold down several keys on your MIDI keyboard for the arpeggiator to walk through them. You may choose to limit the arpeggiator to only the lower-octave notes by checking the "Freehand high octave" option. Also, by default, the arpeggiator walks down the note scale but you can have it walk up the scale instead by checking the "Crawl Up" option.
- Included some basic filtering for notes so that the same keyboard event is not sent to the application multiple times simultaneously. (This was only creating lag issues and didn't actually affect the music being played since it was essentially the same note overlapped.)

Release notes for v0.9.0.2:
- Included the use of Q, the note "B" just below middle-C.
- Included option to alternate or not alternate each octave.

Release notes for v0.9.0.1:
- Remapped octaves such that each octave alternates the use of LOTRO's low or high-octave note sets. This creates a more "varied" sound more easily.

Release notes for v0.9.0.0:
- Initial version.
